This is the client app for booking listing developed using react library.
Command to start application : npm start 
once you start the application it runs on default port : 3000

Some assumptions are made while creating this UI app
1. User will always input either title or author in the **Sort Field** text.
2. User will be able to see 20 search results for the page number selected in **Page Number** field (For real application we can implement pagination)
3. Error responses are not handeled as of now, in real application user will get some popup fro error scenarios.
 
Shown below is the screenshot of how current version of the client looks

**Improvements needed **
1. Implement Pagination
2. Gracefully handle error scenarios
3. Add buttons for **Help** and **Hostname** apis
